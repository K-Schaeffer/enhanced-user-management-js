# enhanced-user-management-js
This project merges two previous projects of mine. 
<br> 
I'm developing it while I study JS and NodeJS/Rest/Restful/Restify and etc with the help of a course.

## Project - That's the architecture (In Brazilian Portuguese)

### What is it?

So, basically it will merge my [user-management-js](https://github.com/K-Schaeffer/user-management-js) with my [demo-restful-apy](https://github.com/K-Schaeffer/demo-restful-api) in one single project. 
<br>

### Folders

- [X] client-server: My "client-server" will "talk" to the client browser, and receive solicitations from it;
- [X] rest-api-nodejs: This is my rest/restful api that will receive the solicitations from the "client-server" and "talk" to the neDB (database);
- [X] user-management-js: This is my application itself, it's the client-side.
